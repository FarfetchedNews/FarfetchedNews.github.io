Finish game.
Maybe find way to automatically update the weather section like maybe something that fetches the information from a place that is easier to edit, for example.
I still haven't checked out neocities as a potential new location.
We should probably leave a file with the current plans for the sequel to the game as well as the "correct" paths for the current iteration.
In general, we have a lot of style issues to fix, I will make an effort to resolve that when I get time - Zach
Also, I'd like if we could start establishing a social media presence for the website so we can more easily spread news.
I set up a form on the weebly site to collect emails for a newsletter so we can better alert viewers to updates. - Zach
Just addded some horizontal lines, changed the weather into columns, and correctly tagged main content and articles - Zach
Note: I did not tag the main content and articles on the Verses - Zach
Just added footers to the main pages - Zach
