Verse of Half-wits
<br></br>
Braden Daum, after a memory lapsed, forgets that it is immoral to give the mortals fire. And also that they Gods shall not interact with the Ignis Fatuus cult. One of the members of the cult, being unfamiliar with the dark and instead appreciating the light left in the void by Ignis Fatuus, prayed that he might receive a way to light the dark. Braden Daum was eavesdropping when he heard that pray, and decided that he might grant this man what it was he was requesting. And having thus decided his course of action, Daum decided to give to the cultist fire, the tool of the Gods. The other Gods, having thus been insulted by Daum, swiftly reprimand Daum and punish him by forcing him to do DGP and making it so that any mortal he sees will appear a LaHood, a being of evil.
