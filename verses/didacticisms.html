Verse of Didacticisms

<br></br>

Eanipsh, a great warrior of the order Streck, sought training from a being of higher skill, that he may finally bringeth an end to the followers of Krause. And so it wert that Eanipsh would encounter the Man of the Berg at Eefousay who would then point Eanipsh to the Great and Wise Schmidt. Eanipsh scaled many a mountain on his quest to find Schmidt, when finally, he found Him; and just in time, for Schmidt was preparing for His annual migration to Vladivostok, where He enjoys many a fine blini. Eanipsh caught Schmidt by surprise, evoking a response from Him. 

"Who are you to ambush me with your presence"

"I am Eanipsh, Warrior of the Order Streck"

"Your pitiful attempt at subterfuge has failed: you are no warrior."

"Aye. I lack the skills of a warrior and wherefore hast I thou bespoken."

"First, don't talk like that, you sound like a blithering dolt. Second, I am leaving for my migration to Vladivostok, and I cannot wait any longer, for the blini are getting cold."

"But"

"I'll have no 'buts' when it comes to my migration. This a very grave matter, and you would do well when to learn yourself some humility."

Learning from His reprimand, Eanipsh elects to remain at Schmidt's retreat in the mountain, that he may prepare himself for His return. For every day that Schmidt was gone, Eanipsh trained and became aller more determined to prove his worth to Schmidt; by the time Schmidt had returned there was an entirely different Eanipsh with a thirst to prove himself and a slight annoyance of the dismissal he had been issued by Schmidt.
On the first day, Schmidt returns his belongings to order and sleeps, having been sated by many blini.
On the second day, Schmidt arises in the morning, climbs to the peak and simply observes the landscape around him for seven hours before returning to sleep.
On the third day, Schmidt prepares for Himself a soup of rock, when He is interrupted by Eanipsh.
Eanipsh seeks training and wants to know wherefore he has been ignored by Schmidt. Schmidt contemplates for a while and tells Eanipsh that to be a great warrior, he must first be willing to act, and until Eanipsh had acted, Schmidt would continue to have ignored him.
It is upon receiving this information that Eanipsh realises that Schmidt did not decline to teach him; rather, the opposite, Schmidt had begun to teach from the moment the two had first interacted. To teach Eanipsh the art of the sword, Schmidt had brought him to a tree to make it aller more obvious the perils of the fight. Schmidt instructs Eanipsh to strike the first blow, which Schmidt deftly parries. Eanipsh, in his ineptitude fails to predict the parry, and, in so doing, loses balance. Eanipsh begins a fall, but is caught by Schmidt who emits the phrase: The geography that I stands compares you superior. Schmidt then releases Eanipsh, cause Eanipsh to break his leg upon hitting the ground. Eanipsh, after recovering from his leg injury, receives further training and becomes a flawless warrior. As Eanipsh is preparing to leave, he tells Schmidt the story of him scaling the mountains to reach Him. Schmidt releases a chortle and asks Eanipsh why he did not simply use the stairs. And, having thus learned of the stairs, Eanipsh leaves forthwith, and all the tragedy of his life soon follows, for Eanipsh would trip on the stairs and die, for he was too perfect to exist. But in his dying breath, Eanipsh issues a prophecy: "Did you hear of the tragedy that reached the man? To be two is to be not, the elder of the hopeless situation also can't be. That is the legend. The man with clothen space is the emperor, he is so strong and big, he can even use the original dint to create life. He deeply understands the dark influence. The dark influence can create matter that many other people can't attain. He will become more and more strong and big lose his power and die. In fact, he teaches his own whole skills to his disciple, who will then kill him. He could let others, but is incapable himself."
