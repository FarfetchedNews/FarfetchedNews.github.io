The town did not know what to do with Chickenleg’s body, so King Robert had prayed to Gods, that they might guide him in the proper method of allowing Chickenleg’s spirit continue to whatever echelon of the Alium he was granted.

Build an elegant shrine to Chickenleg, that his name be remembered, and put his body in a fine sarcophagus, that his body may be put to rest.” And so, the people carried out these orders and constructed many beautiful shrines, the finest that human eyes have ever laid eyes upon.
