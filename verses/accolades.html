King Robert, for his defense of all that was holy, was blessed with 
longevity. Indeed it was so, for King Robert lived long. Robert became 
known as the Holeman for his trap holes were important to the defense of
 Laeta. In death, Robert was granted the title of patron saint of kings 
and trebuchets and was granted access to the center tiers of the Alium.

Adamastor had a statue constructed in his honor and a plaque was placed 
by it. Unfortunately, over time, the people would forget his 
accomplishments and people would no longer honor his name.

The town did not know what to do with Chickenleg's body, so King Robert 
had prayed to Gods, that they might guide him in the proper method of 
allowing Chickenleg's spirit continue to whatever echelon of the Alium 
he was granted. And so Dunn said unto Robert, "Build a shrine to me, and
 I will aid his spirit's transition. And build an elegant shrine to 
Chickenleg, that his name be remembered. And put his body in a fine 
sarcophagus, that his body may be put to rest." And so, the people 
carried out these orders and constructed many beautiful shrines, the 
finest that human eyes have ever laid eyes upon.
