Verse of Condemnations

<br><br>

TJ, for trying to usurp the Alium, was given a second curse. His second 
curse was so, TJ will be able to understand everything that is said to 
him, regardless of language, but no one will understand what he tries to
 communicate, no matter how much effort he gives in. All those who 
assisted him were promptly executed. Those that were involved in the 
leadership of the cult were, after being executed, banished to the 
tutorial world, where they will be forced to build, destroy, and rebuild
 the same house. Yacobi was also banished to the tutorial realm and 
stripped of his powers.
