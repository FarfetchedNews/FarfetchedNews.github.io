		If you look at Farfetched News often, you may have noticed that we have not been posting articles as often as we were when we had just started the paper. We at Farfetched News would like you, as the viewer, to know that this is not because we are lazy. It certainly isn’t because we are procrastinating (why would we be procrastinating now, when we could be procrastinating later). The truth is that our team here at Farfetched News really likes deadlines. We especially like the noise they make when they fly by. It sounds kind of like a whoosh sound, but with a little bit of a whistle at the end of it.
