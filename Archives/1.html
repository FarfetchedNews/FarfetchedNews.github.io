  <h1>Polka Dots</h1>
  <p>Polka dots are a mystery. It seems that almost no one knows exactly where they originate, but everyone has their own theory. Mr. Wall, professional educator, believes that polka dots were invented by the Chinese to infiltrate our computer networks. He attributes power outages and poor internet to polka dots. As to whether or not this is true, we do not know. However, we do know that Mr. Wall believes that the NSA(National Security Administration) will not help us when the Chinese take full control of our computer systems. According to our research, polka dots were in style from the 1850s through the 1950s. Despite "being out of style," the most common opinion of polka dots is neutral. However, some people like only certain colors and shapes of polka dots. While Mr. Bautsch, polka shape egalitarian, feels that polka squares are better, he also believes that all polka shapes are created equal. Another common opinion, not shared by Mr. Bautsch, is that polka dots are overrated and overused; everybody knows that one guy who thinks polka dots are completely awful.
	If you find your views on polka dots changed after reading this article, do not worry for that will likely not effect your personality. We believe that there is nothing wrong with polka dots; we do, however, believe that you should take the advice of Mr. Higus, musician, and refrain from wearing polka dots with stripes.</p>
