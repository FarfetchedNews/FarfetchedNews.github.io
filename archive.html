        <h3 align="center">Polka dots</h3>
        <p>Polka dots are a mystery. It seems that almost no one knows
          exactly where they originate, but everyone has their own
          theory. For example, Mr. Wall believes that polka dots were
          invented by the Chinese to infiltrate our computer network at
          Mossville. He attributes the power outages and the poor
          internet on polka dots. As to whether or not this true, I do
          not know. However, I do know that Mr. Wall believes that the
          NSA(National Security Administration) will not help us when
          the Chinese take full control of our computer systems.
          According to research, polka dots were in style from the
          1850's through the 1950's. Despite "being out of style," the
          most common opinion of polka dots is neutral. However, some
          people like only certain colors of polka dots. While Ethan B.
          feels that polka squares are better, he also believes that all
          polka shapes are created equal. Another common opinion of
          polka dots is that they are overrated or overused. Then, there
          is that one guy(*cough noises*Micah) who claims that polka
          dots are "completely awful." Also, Trevor believes that polka
          dots are stylish. If you find your views on polka dots changed
          after reading this article, do not worry for that will not
          effect your personality. I, for one, believe that there is
          nothing wrong with polka dots. I do, however, believe that you
          should take Mr. Higus's advice and refrain from wearing polka
          dots with stripes.</p>

        <h3 align="center">Roundabouts</h3>
        <p>Roundabouts are a traffic solution that that is gaining
          popularity across the world. So why are they so popular? I
          intend to find out. Despite their apparent popularity,
          citizens have different opinions about roundabouts. For
          example, Alex stated that "they (roundabouts) f*****g suck!"
          He requested that I use three exclamation points. However, I
          do not believe in using more punctuation than is
          necessary...........................................................................................................................................................................
          Some speculate that roundabouts are installed in order to keep
          traffic flowing, while Nathan claims that they are made so
          other people can have fun while driving around them. The
          majority of people believe that roundabouts are a pointless
          waste of money and time. Despite varied opinions, roundabouts
          are becoming increasingly popular around the globe for no
          apparent reason. -Z wus here Z</p>

          juggling was stupid, even more so than cup stacking. So, we

          Star Wars Episode VII: The attack of Jar-Jar No-Brains</h3>
        <p>The new movie opens with Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewbacca in
          the Millennium Falcon in hyperspace entering the Naboo system
          to attempt to destroy the main operating base of the New Order
          army. As they land on the planet, they are ambushed by a hoard
          of Gungans who quickly overrun them. We are then shown that
          they are being led by a masked sith with a very strong
          connection to the force. As the protagonists are captured,
          Mickey Mouse jumps out to sing a song with Minnie and Goofy.
          The song lasts for two hours and is the It's A Small World
          After All over and over and over. If you didn't leave the
          movie after that, the sith unmasks himself and says, ¨Messa´s
          name is Jar-Jar¨. He then proceeds to kill everyone and
          maniacally trip over his own feet causing him to set off a
          bomb that explodes the entire planet. But, he somehow survives
          and takes over the galaxy. THE END</p>

        <h3 align="center">School Food</h3>
        <p>School food is an apparently edible object that most people
          attempt to eat every day. However, most people have no idea
          what is in school food and do not realize that by eating it,
          they may very well be shortening their lifespan. An anonymous
          staff member of Mossville school was interviewed. When we
          asked what was in school food, he attempted to dodge the
          question by saying that it was standard for the state of
          Illinois. The most obvious proof is the reactions different
          students show when they are interviewed about our potentially
          deadly food. “I think it is made of animal
          organs/yuck”,”Yuck”, and “Well I think the school lunches
          taste and look absolutely horrendous. The picture for this
          poll that was used I think is a very accurate.-- I hate it”
          (the picture shows a green blob). Food described in this way
          can’t be good for you. The quantities are also lacking. Before
          I switched to cold lunch, I found myself eating hot lunch. Not
          only is all of the meat pink, there is so little of it that
          you will find yourself getting hungry before school is out.
          The pints milk contain chewy bits inside and the fruit tastes
          like it was grown last year. While we can not prove that
          school food is toxic, we highly recommend avoiding it.</p>

        <p>The scholastic bowl team lost its first match on Tuesday. The
          Boys' basketball team lost in sectionals this week(Get

          in the state competition this week as well. IMPORTANT NOTE:
          YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT THIS SECTION IS NEGLECTED. WE ARE
          ATTEMPTING TO REMEDY THIS. MICAH AND SILAS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
          REPORTING SPORTS NEWS TO US BUT, THEY HAVE PROVED UNRELIABLE.
          AS A RESULT, WE ARE HIRING FOR A REPLACEMENT. I WILL TURN

        <h3 align="center">Crop Circle Found On School Grounds</h3>
        <p>On the date of January 21, 2016, a strange crop circle was
          found outside of Mossville School. How was it formed? What
          does it mean? Is this a hoax? Read on and find out.Ethan B,
          who witnessed the formation of the crop circle, informed us
          that it was made by a large snowman. His interview revealed
          one more thing: the snowman went into the grass because it
          found that the road was too difficult to follow. This
          difficulty was obviously caused by the seemingly easy to
          navigate roundabouts that were recently installed nearby. Had
          the roundabout not been there, the snowman would never have
          left the road. And, as a result, Ethan would never have
          encountered the enormous snowman and would not be left in his
          traumatic state. Jansan, (who requested that she be called
          Mrs. Bond) had this to say about the crop circle, "That's a
          crop circle? Make sure you put a question mark in the?re."
          There are also multiple other theories about the crop circle's
          formation that differ from the eye witness account. For
          example, Trevor believes that it was made by aliens. Dustin
          believes that the crop circle was made by a Syrian prince. Mr.
          Wall believes that the crop circle lines up with the Latitude
          and Longitude lines of Illinois. He also believes that it is
          definitely some sort of message. We had our pilot(and human
          resources director), Jacob "JZ" D. engage in a fly-by of the
          area. This fly-by revealed that the crop circle was in fact
          part of a larger crop circle that formed the phrase, "shut
          up." JZ believes that the creator of the crop circle is angry
          at humans for allowing Miley Cyrus to "twerk." Z WUS HERE! Z</p>

        <h3 align="center">Volcano Safety Procedures</h3>
        <p>This week, eighth graders have been working on earthquake
          safety procedures. This got me thinking, and I asked myself:
          why are we so unprepared for other potentially dangerous
          emergencies, such as volcanic eruption? As far as I could
          tell, we have absolutely no plan for when a volcano erupts. To
          get to the bottom of this, I interviewed celebrity teacher,
          Mr. Mckown. When interviewed he said that our lack of safety
          procedures scared him on a regular basis. However, many
          believe that volcano safety procedures are unnecessary due to
          our lack of volcanoes in proximity. In response, I ask you
          this: did the citizens of Pompeii know their was an active
          volcano nearby? If they had prepared precautionary measures,
          that tragedy would have been much less tragic. Just because we
          have no knowledge of volcanic danger does not mean we should
          be unprepared.</p>

        <h3 align="center">Just a Thought</h3>
        <p> I went to a McDonald’s last week and made a simple order. I
          ordered a sad meal. They said that they don’t have sad meals,
          and for that reason they could not serve me. Sad people need
          to eat too, yet McDonald’s utterly refuses to acknowledge
          their existence. This is cruel and unusual punishment that
          McDonald’s is inflicting upon its customers. We can not allow
          McDonald’s to discriminate not only against people who are
          sad, but against anyone who is an emotion other than happy. I
          am officially boycotting McDonald’s. I can not eat at a
          restaurant that openly tries to force happiness upon its
          customers. We need to end this tyranny against sad people
          around the world. I know not what course others may take; but
          as for me, give me sad meal or give me death!</p>
